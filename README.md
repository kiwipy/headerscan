# Email Header Scanner

## Description
Script to parse and analyse email header files.<br>
It prints a summery in easy to read format and also looks up ip addresses and lets you save the parsed file.
## Install and usage
Install with **`sudo ./install.sh`**<br>
Run **`headerscan /path/to/header-file`**

## Notes
This is a "quick and dirty" script so far. It works but there might be alot of bugs and things that I missed.<br> 
I plan to re-write it in the future and add more functionality.
