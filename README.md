# Email Header Scanner

## Description
Script to parse and analyse email header files. It prints a summery in easy to read format and also looks up ip addresses and lets you save the parsed file. It color codes suspicious features and gives you a verdict. If base64 is present it will ask to view it.
## Install and usage
Install with **`sudo ./install.sh`**<br>
Run **`headerscan /path/to/header-file`**

## Notes
This is a "quick and dirty" script, bugs and unintended behaviour expected.<br>
Stable version will be written in python.
